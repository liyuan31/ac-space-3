<p>Last week on my thesis exam, we mentioned whether participants were becoming
more optimal over time. Here, I revisit the previously published results in our
lab, complementing them with Molly's (2019) and AC Space 3 data, and try to
address this question more clearly.</p>

<p>To preview, there seems to be mixed results regarding this question. Some
show that participants were more optimal over time, but some do not show such
trend.</p>

<p>We also addressed the We also addressed the possibility that the inefficient behavior
was due to inexperience with the task. Performance maximization
may only emerge after significant experience with the
changing environment, so we assessed the effect of experience
by comparing performance in the first and second half of the
experiment. Results showed that the proportions of target
choices did not change from the first to the second half of
the experiment (no main effect of half, F(1, 42) = 2.12,
p=0.15, !p
2 =0.05, and no half by run position interaction,
F(11, 462) = 0.86, p = 0.58, !p
2 = 0.02). Additionally, there
was no change to the cumulative switches (no main effect,
F(1, 42)= 1.33, p=0.26, !p
2 =0.03, and no interaction, F(11,
462)= 1.05, p=0.40, !p
2=0.02).</p>

<p>Finally, let's get to AC Space. In the current project, we had participants
completed three blocks of standard ACVS followed by three blocks of the spatial
version. </p>

<p>To get a better dynamical visualization of how optimality and switch rate
change over time, I made a line chart that has on y axis the propotion of
optimal choices in the last ten trials.</p>
